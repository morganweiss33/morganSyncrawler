        <p class="lead mb-5">I am a senior at the University of Dayton, I am
          studying Computer Information Systems through the Department of Computer
           Science and I am also
          minoring in Communications. I am on track to graduate in December 2019,
          but I am hoping to have an educational experience and intern in Spring of
          2020. I have spent the last three summers interning at Hyland Software in
          Westlake, OH with their Technical Support Department (2017) and the
          Research & Development Department as a Quality Assurance Intern (2018 & 2019). <br><br>
         <br> <br>
          I am  interested in full-time employment for after my graduation
         in May of 2020, and I have no preference to location. My passion is front-end web
         development although I also enjoy full-stack development and UX Design.

            <p>During the first week of August I took the innovative to build the site you are
              on now. Over the last year I discovered my passion for front-end development
              so I decided to put that knowledge to use in a way that was enjoyable for myself.
              With the help of bootstrap I was able to create what you see now. I am looking forward
              to constantly updating it to stay current with the latest in front-end development.
              As a soon to be college graduate I saw the importance of knowing how to
              host a website and connect that to a domain. This site is hosted on my GitHub account
              and I have configured GitHub to recognize 'www.morgankweiss.com' by adding a GitHub DNS
              within my Google Domain. My purchase Google Domain uses a GitHub IP address to allow
              the computer to access my domain name through it.

        <h3>It all started my sophmore year of high school... </h3>
        <p>
          During this time (2014) I started helping my grandparents
          with their iPhones and iPads they were getting for birthdays and Christmas.
           This soon turned into weekly visits and progressed to teaching them social media as well.
           During one of my weekly visits my grandma invited her friend over because
           she needed help since her family did not live in the area. I started to
           wonder how many other seniors are out in my community that would benefit
           from this type of service. I was fortunate with the timing because I had recently been elected
           to be the president of Key Club at my high school for the upcoming (2014) academic year.
           I thought about this and knew once I began this position (beginning of my junior year) I
           would start a program to help seniors in our community with technology and
           social media and call it “TechConnect”. TechConnect not only provided a
           much-needed service in our community but it was able to provide community
            service hours for Key Club members. I had meetings with my advisor and
             high school principal to get approval, meetings in the community to
              find a place to host the event, and a meeting with the City Mayor
              to get the word out and see if he had additional ideas on how to
               promote it. I reached out to newspapers and ended up being interviewed
               by local newspapers to promote TechConnect.
               TechConnect has not only provided tech support for seniors but it has
               also started friendships, bridged two different generations, and with
                the repeat visitors each month it is also a place to meet new people. Six years later
                 I am proud to say this program is still running and now occurs twice a month.
               Over my winter breaks I still attend the January session. This program is what created my spark
               for technology and what eventually led me to purse my current degree at the University
                of Dayton.
